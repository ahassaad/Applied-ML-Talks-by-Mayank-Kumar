### Exploratory-Data-Analysis by Mayank Kumar at ITM University Gwalior

This is my talk over the topic "Exploratory Data Analysis" at ITM University, Gwalior, 
where I have shared some of the approaches that we can use to perform exploratory data analysis. 
I have covered some basic statistical terms and techniques to get started with EDA. 
I hope it will be useful for someone who is just starting with data analysis and want to 
learn some approaches and terminologies related to EDA.
