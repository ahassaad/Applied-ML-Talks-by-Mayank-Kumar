#### ACM-RAIT-Approaching-text-summarization-using-ML-and-DNN-(26-05-2020)-Mayank-Kumar

This is my talk over the topic "Approaching Text Summarization using Machine Learning 
and Deep Neural Network" in STTP on ML DL by RAIT ACM 2020, where I have shared some 
of the approaches that we can use to create a text summarizer. I have covered various 
approaches ranging from classical NLP methods to some of the best current state of the 
art approaches like BERT. I hope it will be useful for someone who is just starting with 
NLP or is a beginner in NLP. We will be looking at both the problem formulation as well 
as the python implementation of one of the solutions.
